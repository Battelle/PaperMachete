This folder serves two purposes:
	1. It's where you put the binaries or Binary Ninja databases you want to analyze (PE, ELF, Mach-O, .bndb)
	2. It's where analysis files (JSON) are stored after being processed by Paper Machete.

The Paper Machete CLI `paper_machete.py` enumerates this folder when presenting you with analysis/migration options.

FAQ:
Q: What if my target isn't a PE/ELF/Mach-O executable? It's a binary blob!
A: Analyze it with Binary Ninja and save your analysis as a .bndb file in this folder.
